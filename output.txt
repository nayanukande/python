# tHE hOPE #

i HAVE HOPED, i HAVE PLANNED, i HAVE STRIVEN,
tO THE WILL i HAVE ADDED THE DEED;
tHE BEST THAT WAS IN ME iÂ€™VE GIVEN,
i HAVE PRAYED, BUT THE GODS WOULD NOT HEED,

i HAVE DARED AND REACHED ONLY DISASTER,
i HAVE BATTLED AND BROKEN MY LANCE;
i AM BRUISED BY A PITILESS MASTER
tHAT THE WEAK AND THE TIMID CALL cHANCE,

i AM OLD, i AM BENT, i AM CHEATED
oF ALL THAT yOUTH URGED ME TO WIN;
bUT NAME ME NOT WITH THE DEFEATED,
fOR TOMORROW AGAIN, i BEGIN,
